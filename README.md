Technical Description Schemas Hierarchy
--------------------------------------

This repository contains the following subdirectories, each with its own README, that contain schemas and models:

-   xsd – XML schemas for the Common Transactive Services (CTS)

-   json — JSON schemas to serialize the Common Transactive Services (CTS)
    payloads

-   UML - PDF files of UML models used from Energy Interoperation, EMIX, and the XML schemas in this folder

Built With
----------

These schemas were originally defined for the [NIST-CTS-Agents](https://github.com/EnergyMashupLab/NIST-CTS-Agents) which project uses Github, Maven, Java 8, and Spring Boot 2. That project now uses the Java Persistence API and does not directly consume these schemas, although the Java code there was based on these XSDs, which are an evolution of the [OASIS Energy Interoperation](http://docs.oasis-open.org/energyinterop/ei/v1.0/os/energyinterop-v1.0-os.html) schemas.
